# IBM's Watsonx.ai Engine

## Overview

IBM Watsonx.ai is an enterprise-ready AI and data platform that enables organizations to scale and accelerate the impact of AI. The platform consists of a set of tools designed to help users build, deploy, and manage AI models with greater efficiency and control. In this project, we've integrated Watsonx.ai through the wxflows toolkit to provide powerful AI tool capabilities.

## Key Components

### Watsonx.ai Core Features

1. **Foundation Models**: Pre-trained large language models that can be customized for specific business needs.
2. **AI Governance**: Tools to manage AI lifecycles with transparency and control.
3. **Streamlined Development**: Simplified model training, fine-tuning, and deployment.
4. **Enterprise Integration**: Secure integration with existing enterprise systems and data sources.

### Wxflows Implementation

In our project, we use [wxflows](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-ai-studio) (Watsonx Flows) to create and manage AI workflows. Wxflows provides a GraphQL-based interface to define and deploy AI tools that can be used by our chatbot.

```typescript
// Sample configuration for Wxflows tools
{
  "endpoint": "api/ill-gas",
  "tools": [
    "web_search",
    "wikipedia",
    "google_books",
    "math",
    "exchange",
    "open_meteo_weather",
    "news"
  ]
}
```

## Benefits for This Project

1. **Modular Tool System**: Easily add, remove, or modify AI tools through the wxflows configuration.
2. **Enterprise-Grade Security**: Secure handling of API calls and data processing.
3. **Scalability**: Handle varying loads of user requests efficiently.
4. **GraphQL Integration**: Structured queries and responses for consistent data handling.

## Architecture

The IBM Watsonx.ai integration in our project follows this architecture:

1. User query is received by the frontend application
2. The query is processed by our LangChain/Langgraph implementation
3. If external data or processing is needed, the appropriate tool is called via Wxflows
4. Wxflows routes the request to the appropriate IBM Watsonx.ai service
5. Results are returned through the GraphQL API and incorporated into the response
6. The processed response is streamed back to the user

## Getting Started

To work with IBM's Watsonx.ai in this project, you'll need:

1. IBM Cloud account with Watsonx.ai access
2. API credentials configured in the `.env` file
3. Wxflows SDK installed (`@wxflows/sdk`)

For detailed setup instructions, see the [Setting Up IBM's Watsonx.ai Engine (Wxflows)](#) section of this documentation.
